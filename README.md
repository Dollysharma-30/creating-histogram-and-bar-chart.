# creating-histogram-and-bar-chart.

1. Project Overview

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook that generates a Histogram and Bar Chart using the provided Titanic-Dataset.csv. The purpose is to perform basic exploratory data analysis and visualize key patterns from the Titanic dataset.

2. Files Included

create-histogram-and-bar-chart.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing Python code for data loading, cleaning, and visualization.

Titanic-Dataset.csv – Dataset used for generating visualizations.

3. Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries: bash\pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

4. How to Run the Notebook

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or VS Code.

Make sure the dataset Titanic-Dataset.csv is in the same directory.

Run each cell to load data and generate visualizations.

5. Visualizations Generated
1. Histogram

Shows the distribution of numerical features such as Age, Fare, etc.

2. Bar Chart

Represents categorical variable counts such as Survived, Pclass, Sex, etc.

6. Project Workflow
